// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic.  Without the code,
// I can only provide a placeholder declaration.  A real solution would require examining the
// original code to determine the correct type and initial value for these variables.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const it = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const is = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value
const and = null // Replace null with the correct type and initial value

// Assume the rest of the original code follows, using these variables.
// In a real scenario, the above declarations would be placed at the top of the component
// or within the appropriate scope where these variables are used.
